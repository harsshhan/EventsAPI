# EventsAPI

An event management API built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) ðŸ”¥ and MongoDB.
I chose FastAPI for building EventsAPI primarily because of its speed and performance. FastAPI is one of the fastest web frameworks available, as itâ€™s built on standard Python type hints, leveraging asyncio for high-performance asynchronous code execution.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework.
- **Database**: MongoDB for efficient document storage.
- **API Documentation**: Self-documented with OpenAPI and Swagger at `/docs`.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- MongoDB (locally or hosted, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or `pip` for installing dependencies

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harsshhan/EventsAPI.git
cd EventsAPI
```

2. Setup Virtual Environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a .env file with the following content:

```bash
DB_URL=mongodb+srv://<your-username>:<your-password>@<your-cluster-url>/<your-database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
DB_NAME=your-database-name
```
Make sure to replace the placeholders to with your MongoDB credentials



### Running the app

1. Run the App

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## API Endpoints

`POST /events`
Create a new event. Requires a JSON body:

`GET /events/{id}`
Retrieve an event by its ID.

`PATCH /events/{id}`
Update an existing event by its ID. Requires a JSON body with updated details.

`DELETE /events/{id}`
Delete an event by its ID.

## [Documentation]()

The API is documented using OpenAPI. Access the Swagger UI for exploration:

- Swagger UI: `/docs`


## Docker

You can run the application using Docker. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

To build and run the containers, use:
